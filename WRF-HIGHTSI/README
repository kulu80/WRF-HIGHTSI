How to compile and use the WRF-HIGHTSI?

1. Download and compile the original WRFV3.6.1 first.

2. Set the environment variable "WRFROOT" to the path of the original WRFV3.6.1.
   export WRFROOT=path_of_origional_WRF3.6.1

3. Substitute the source code and recompile WRFV3.
   ./update_recompile

This will generate the WRF-HIGHTSI which compiled HIGHTSI rather than Noah as sea ice model.
